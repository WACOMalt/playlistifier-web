### Technical Architecture
```
Frontend (Vanilla JS + 98.css) ↔ WebSocket ↔ Node.js/Express Backend
                                                    ↓
                                            Service Layer
                                        ↙               ↘
                                Spotify API          YouTube
                                    ↓                  ↓
                                OAuth/Public        yt-dlp
                                    ↓                  ↓
                                    FFmpeg ← Audio Processing
                                        ↓
                                File System (MP3 + Metadata)
```

### Processing Pipeline
1. **URL Input** → Platform detection and validation
2. **Authentication** → OAuth flow if required (Spotify private content)
3. **Metadata Extraction** → Track information retrieval
4. **Display** → User review and configuration
5. **Download** → Concurrent audio extraction and processing
6. **Metadata Embedding** → ID3 tags and artwork integration
7. **Organization** → Folder structure creation with playlists
